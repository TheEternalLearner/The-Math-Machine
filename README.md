# The-Math-Machine

This is a hugo generated website for my futur math projects. It uses bulma and fontawesome (using cdns).

## Installation

### On linux

#### Hugo

To install hugo I used one of the following commands :
> `sudo pacman -S hugo`
>
> `yay hugo (install the community/hugo packet )`

However depending on your OS/distribution you can find a more appropriate commad at [install Hugo][1].

#### Git

use the following command to install the directory:
> `git clone https://github.com/TheEternalLearner/The-Math-Machine.git`

## Running the site locally

Run the server locally using the appropriate hugo command :
> `cd The-Math-Machine`
>
> `hugo server -D`

The site should now be accessible at [localhost:1313][2] in your web browser.
